<p>Provides a set of classes for defining <i>Actions</i> which are run
in order to carry out application behaviour that the user has requested
through the user-interface. Two types of actions are supported, namely <i>plugin-in</i>
actions, and <i>retargetable</i> (or global) actions. Both kinds of
actions are eligible to be repeated through the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.action.ActionManager}.</p>

<p>The <i>plugin-in</i> actions can be contributed using the extension
points provided by the Eclipse platform, namely:
<ul>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.actionsSets</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.editorActions</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.viewActions</li>
</ul>
The behaviour of these action extensions is defined in an
<i>action delegate</i>
. Modeling platform
<i>plugin-in</i>
action implementations should subclass the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.action.AbstractActionDelegate} class
in this package and implement the interface(s) appropriate to the
Eclipse platform extension point(s) being used.
</p>

<p>The <i>retargetable</i> (or global) actions can be contributed using
the extension points provided by the Eclipse platform, namely:
<ul>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</li>
	<li>org.eclipse.ui.editors</li>
</ul>
The behaviour of these action extensions is defined in an
<i>action handler</i>
. Modeling platform
<i>retargetable</i>
action implementations should subclass the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.action.AbstractActionHandler} class in
this package.
</p>

<p>Modeling platform actions are run through an instance of the {@link
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.action.ActionManager} class. The
action manager will keep track of the last action that was run that is
eligible to be repeated.</p>
