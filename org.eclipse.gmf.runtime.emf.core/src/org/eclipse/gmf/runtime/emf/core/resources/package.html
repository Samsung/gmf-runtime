GMF resource API.  This package provides the GMF 
resource factory responsible for creating GMF resources.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package defines the
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.GMFResourceFactory} class that
creates GMF resources.  It is not intended to be used by client code, but to
be referenced on the EMF <tt>org.eclipse.emf.ecore.extension_parser</tt>
extension point to associate the client application's file extension with the
resource factory.  Associated with this factory is the
{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.GMFResource} class which is
GMF's custom resource implementation, supporting path map URIs and automatic
URI denormalization and modification tracking.
</p>
<p>
This package also defines a {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.resources.PathmapManager}
class which has static API methods for managing path map variables, in particular
for defining path maps statically for your plug-in's resources.
