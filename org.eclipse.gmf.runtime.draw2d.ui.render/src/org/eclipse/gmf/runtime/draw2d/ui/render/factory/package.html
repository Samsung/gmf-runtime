Contains the factory class and supporting classes.  The factory class may have dependencies into all the
different supported files formats hence it is separated into it's own package namespace.  The factory class should 
be the central location where specific variants of the <code>RenderedImage</code> implementors are created.  This
allows clients to make generic calls to the factory with a file buffer and have it return a valid instance or not.
Clients therefore don't have to assume any knowledge of a specific image file type.
