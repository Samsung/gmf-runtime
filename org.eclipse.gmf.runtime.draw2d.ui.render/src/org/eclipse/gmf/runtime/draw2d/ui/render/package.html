This package contains the default interfaces for defining and using a <code>RenderedImage</code>.  
The concept of a RenderedImage is to encapsulate the image format from the clients.  
It also allows for dynamic rendering of the image format based on the current resolution of the 
device or scale factor.  Vector formats can then be taken advantage of since this can provide more 
or less detail depending on the target resolution.
