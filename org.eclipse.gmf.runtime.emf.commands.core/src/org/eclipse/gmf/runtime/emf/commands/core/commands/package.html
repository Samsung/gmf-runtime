A collection of concrete (or at least partially realized) commands that may
be reused by any MSL client application.  These commands implement the
API of the {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.commands.core.command} package
and offer such generic capabilities as "create an <tt>EObject</tt>" or
"reposition an <tt>EObject</tt> in an <tt>EList</tt>."
