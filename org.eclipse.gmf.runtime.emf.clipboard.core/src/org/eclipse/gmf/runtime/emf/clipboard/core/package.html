API for clipboard-oriented copy/paste services that are customizable for
metamodel-specific semantics.  For invocation of the copy/paste functionality,
see {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.ClipboardUtil}.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The primary mechanism for customization of a meta-model's copy/paste requirements
is the {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.IClipboardSupport}
interface.  Where this interface is not sufficient to control copy/paste
behaviour, the specialization of the following classes is permitted to define
custom copy and paste operations:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.OverrideCopyOperation}:
    for special copying behaviour.  This class inherits a number of useful
    operations from the
    {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.CopyOperation} class to
    find out about the objects that the user selected for copying, additional
    objects required my the <code>IClipboardSupport</code>, and the
    relationships between them.  It also has methods for adding elements to be
    copied</li>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.OverridePasteChildOperation}:
    for special pasting behaviour.  This class inherits a wealth of useful
    operations from the
    {@link org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.clipboard.core.PasteChildOperation} class to
    find out about the objects that the user selected for copying, additional
    objects required my the <code>IClipboardSupport</code>, and the
    relationships between them.  It also has methods do find which elements have
    failed to paste, to paste additional elements (including handling paste
    collisions), etc.</li>
</ul>
